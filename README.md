##Technical Report on the Titanic Passenger Dataset

By Sochima Madueke

Introduction

I recently got into the HNG 11 Internship program and this is a task I am to carry out to progress to the next level.

The dataset analyzed in this report is from Kaggle and it provides information about the passengers who boarded the RMS Titanic. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. While some element of luck was involved in surviving, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

Objective

The purpose of this review is to

1. Understand structure and contents of the dataset and identify key variables and data types.

2. Initial Data Exploration by conducting a quick review of the dataset without deep analysis and identify obvious patterns, trends, or anomalies in the data.

3. Note any initial insights that can be immediately observed from the dataset

4. Write a brief technical report detailing your observations.

Variable/Definition/Key — Data Type

Survival/Survival/0 = No, 1 = Yes — Integer

sibsp/# of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic — Integer

parch/# of parents/children aboard the Titanic — Integer

ticket/Ticket number — String

fare/Passenger fare — Float

cabin/Cabin number — String

embarked/Port of Embarkation/C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton — String

Conclusion

From the observations above, more men were on the Titanic but less were saved. Also, those in the first class on the boat had a higher tendency to survive. I also noticed that those who travelled alone survived better than those with family. Further analysis can show reasons for the observations above and throw more insights one the dataset.
